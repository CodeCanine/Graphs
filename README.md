# Graphs
Graph method practice

This project is a practice of the Graph data structure implementation and it's methods. 2 Separate Classes to define the methods (methods.py), and execution (main.py)

n = number of nodes Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n)

Challenges:

Graphs are not Python implemented base data structures, has to be created manually.
Graph Algorithms require deep understanding of the Graph data structure.

Approach:

Understanding the problem
Create edge cases
Creating Methods class
Creating basic methods
Testing methods with manual cases
Creating advanced methods
Testing methods with random variables
